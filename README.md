# Smart Dustbin System

## 📌 Overview 
The Smart Dustbin System is an Arduino-based solution designed to improve waste management and hygiene. It automatically opens the dustbin lid when a user approaches and monitors the garbage level to prevent overflow, making it suitable for smart city applications.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Promote contactless and hygienic waste disposal
- Automatically open and close the dustbin lid
- Monitor garbage fill level
- Prevent overflow and improve waste management efficiency

---

## ⚙️ System Working
- An ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of a user near the dustbin.
- When an object is detected within a predefined distance, a servo motor opens the lid.
- Another sensor can be used to monitor the garbage level inside the bin.
- The system operates automatically without manual intervention.
